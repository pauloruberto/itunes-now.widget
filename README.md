This is my modified fork of the [itunes-now.widget](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht-widgets/tree/master/iTunes-now) for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/), based off of [sheriferson](https://github.com/sheriferson/itunes-now.widget)'s original fork.

The widget displays some information about the currently playing track in iTunes at the bottom of the screen.

(Übersicht is an app to display widgets, information, or metrics on the desktop for OS X. It's essentially a niftier version of [GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/).)

The original `itunes-now.widget` from sheriferson was a little bit too busy for my liking, so I simplified it down to only the track name & artist.

Here is a screenshot:
